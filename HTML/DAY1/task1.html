    <h1>HTML HISTORY</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <div>
    
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt img &gt and &lt input &gt directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt p &gt and &lt /p &gt surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt canvas &gt element, together with JavaScript.

    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <div class="c1">
        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]

After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[12]

Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.[14]

<h4>The Evolution of HTML:</h4>
    <h4>The First HTML Specification</h4>
    <p>n 1991, Berners-Lee created the first version of HTML, which was based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). This version of HTML was very basic and only included a few tags, such as &lt P &gt for paragraphs and &lt H1 &gt for headings</p>

  <h4>  HTML 2.0</h4>
<p>HTML 2.0 was the second version of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which was released in 1995. It was the first version to receive wide adoption and was supported by most web browsers of the time, including Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.

HTML 2.0 introduced several new features that were not present in the original version of HTML. One of the most significant additions was support for tables, which allowed web developers to create more complex page layouts.

HTML 2.0 also added support for the &lt IMG &gt tag, which enabled the inclusion of images on web pages. Prior to HTML 2.0, images had to be included using complex workarounds, such as embedding them as background images or using external plugins.

Another important addition to HTML 2.0 was the &lt FORM &gt tag, which allowed users to input data into web pages. This enabled the creation of interactive web pages, such as online forms and surveys.&lt /FORM &gt</p>

<h4>HTML 3.0</h4>
<p>HTML 3.0 was the third version of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which was released in 1995. It was the first version to be standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the organization responsible for setting web standards.

    HTML 3.0 introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessor, HTML 2.0. One of the most significant additions was the ability to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which allowed for more advanced and consistent styling of web pages.
    
    HTML 3.0 also added support for new form elements, such as drop-down menus, radio buttons, and checkboxes. These features made it easier to create complex forms and collect data from users.
    
    Another important addition to HTML 3.0 was the introduction of tables with merged cells, which enabled the creation of more complex page layouts. HTML 3.0 also introduced support for inline images and improved support for image maps.</p>

    <h4>HTML 4.0</h4>
    <p>HTML 4.0 was the fourth version of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which was released in 1997. It was the first version to be fully standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the organization responsible for setting web standards.

        HTML 4.0 introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessor, HTML 3.2. One of the most significant additions was the ability to use frames, which allowed web developers to divide a web page into separate sections that could be updated independently.
        
        Another important addition to HTML 4.0 was the introduction of the &lt DIV &gt and &lt SPAN &gt tags, which allowed web developers to group and style sections of a web page. This feature made it easier to create more complex page layouts and provided greater control over the presentation of web content.
        
        HTML 4.0 also introduced new form controls, such as text fields with automatic completion and password fields with masking. These features made it easier for users to input data into web forms and improved the security of online transactions.
        Additionally, HTML 4.0 introduced improved support for multimedia, including the ability to embed audio and video files directly into web pages using the &lt EMBED &gt tag.

            HTML 4.0 remained the dominant version of HTML for many years and was widely supported by web browsers of the time, including Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and Mozilla Firefox. However, with the increasing complexity of web applications and the need for greater standardization, HTML 4.0 was eventually replaced by newer versions of HTML, such as XHTML and HTML5.</p>
            <h4>XHTML</h4>
            <p>XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that is derived from HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It was developed to provide stricter rules for creating web pages that could be read by both humans and machines.

                XHTML follows the same basic syntax and structure as HTML, but it is based on the stricter syntax rules of XML (Extensible Markup Language). This means that XHTML documents are well-formed and conform to a defined set of rules, making them easier to parse and validate by web browsers and other software.
                
                XHTML was first introduced in 2000 as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using XML 1.0 syntax. It aimed to address some of the limitations of HTML, such as its inconsistent handling of tags and attributes and its tendency to produce malformed or poorly structured code.
                
                One of the key benefits of XHTML is that it provides greater compatibility with other web standards, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. It also allows web developers to create web pages that are accessible to a wider range of devices and platforms, including mobile devices and assistive technologies</p>

                <h4>HTML5</h4>
<p>HTML5 is the fifth and latest version of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It was released in 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the organization responsible for setting web standards.

HTML5 introduces a wide range of new features and improvements over its predecessors, including better support for multimedia, improved accessibility, and enhanced compatibility with mobile devices. Some of the key features of HTML5 include:</p>
